          You might think there are so few Muslims in this beautiful Eastern European capital, that
          you would not find a mosque to pray in or a restaurant to eat halal meat in. This is not
          the case, however. In Budapest, you can pray in mosques and you can eat halal food. You can
          even visit one of our famous baths without seeing what you do not want to see.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          And&hellip; You can have a guide who understand your culture and religion! Our professional
          licensed guides are all locals, who cannot wait to show you the beauty of Budapest.
