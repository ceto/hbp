                    You might think there are so few Muslims in this beautiful Eastern European capital, that you would not find a mosque to pray in or a restaurant to eat halal meat in. This is not the case, however. In Budapest, you can pray in mosques and you can eat halal food. You can even visit one of our famous baths without seeing what you do not want to see.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">And you can do all this with the expert help of a Muslim guide. Our professional licensed guides are all locals, who cannot wait to show you the beauty of Budapest.</p>
