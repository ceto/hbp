                    You might think there are so few Muslims in this beautiful Eastern-European capital, that you can not find a mosque to pray and a restaurant to eat halal meat? You are wrong. You can pray in mosques. You can eat halal food. You can even visit one of our famous baths without seeing what you do not want to see.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">And&hellip; You can have a Muslim guide! Our professional, experienced and licensed guides are all locals, who can not wait to show you the beauty of Budapest  </p>
