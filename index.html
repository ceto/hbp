                    We love travelling, but we heard so much bad news about Hungary that we never thought of choosing it as
                    destination. On our holiday we want to feel comfortable, to find mosques, to eat halal food and first of
                    all to be safe. I am so happy I met you, guys. We had great time! Now we know much more about Budapest,
                    and we are going to send our friends as well.

                    I came to Hungary as a journalist. I was interested in recent political tendencies, immigration issues.
                    I got in contact with the local Muslim community, and they recommended the Halal Budapest team. It was
                    amazing! I really got insight information from Anna, who was very knowledgeable and obviously enjoyed
                    what she was doing. I could have the chance to meet researchers, local colleagues and interviewees.
                    Thanks for her! I could collect what I came for. And what is more, I could have exceptional sightseeing
                    experience!

                    <img src="/assets/img/testimonials/small/nand.jpg" alt="Norhan and Noran" /> We loved Budapest,
                    especially its impressive architecture and its vibrant culture. We loved the old sights that are
                    beautifully preserved - like the Parliament and the St. Stephen’s Basilica. The life is totally
                    different inside the Old Castle. It is like an amazing little village. I highly recommend it if you are
                    interested in a beautiful city with centuries of history… And it is a totally safe city, definitely.

                    I came here on a business trip and we couldn't find many halal restaurants. But you showed us the best
                    place where we could have real Hungarian goulash soup made in halal way! It is nowhere in the guide
                    books :) We also had nice food in Syrian and Lebanese restaurants in Budapest, but this goulash soup was
                    the highlight. I love good cuisine, but it is problematic to try local specialties in non Muslim
                    countries...They are not made in the right way. I also recommend the fish soup in Hungary, it you do not
                    find halal meat. But it is also tricky as very few places make really good fish soup in Budapest…

                    We always think of Hungarians as friends. So much in common, history, cuisine, even language. It was
                    amazing to hear about the Ottoman era, and to understand the local point of view. Also interesting facts
                    about coffee, paprika and much more. The view from the Fishermen’s Bastion was fantastic and I enjoyed
                    the cruise on the Danube. I especially loved the Parliament Building.
