                    We love travelling, but we heard so much bad news about Hungary
                    that we never thought of choosing it as destination. On our
                    holiday we want to feel comfortable, to find mosques, to eat
                    halal food and first of all to be safe. I am so happy I met you,
                    guys. We had great time! Now we know much more about Budapest,
                    and we are going to send our friends as well.

                    I came to Hungary as a journalist. I was interested in recent
                    political tendencies, immigration issues. I got in contact with
                    the local Muslim community, and they recommended the Halal
                    Budapest team. It was amazing! I really got insight information
                    from Anna, who was very knowledgeable and obviously enjoyed what
                    she was doing. I could have the chance to meet researchers,
                    local colleagues and interviewees. Thanks for her! I could
                    collect what I came for. And what is more, I could have
                    exceptional sightseeing experience!

                    We loved Budapest, especially its impressive architecture and
                    its vibrant culture. We loved the old sights that are
                    beautifully preserved - like the Parliament and the St.
                    Stephenâ€™s Basilica. The life is totally different inside the Old
                    Castle. It is like an amazing little village. I highly recommend
                    it if you are interested in a beautiful city with centuries of
                    historyâ€¦ And it is a totally safe city, definitely.

                    I came here on a business trip and we couldn't find many halal
                    restaurants. But you showed us the best place where we could
                    have real Hungarian goulash soup made in halal way! It is
                    nowhere in the guide books :) We also had nice food in Syrian
                    and Lebanese restaurants in Budapest, but this goulash soup was
                    the highlight. I love good cuisine, but it is problematic to try
                    local specialties in non Muslim countries...They are not made in
                    the right way. I also recommend the fish soup in Hungary, it you
                    do not find halal meat. But it is also tricky as very few places
                    make really good fish soup in Budapestâ€¦

                    We always think of Hungarians as friends. So much in common,
                    history, cuisine, even language. It was amazing to hear about
                    the Ottoman era, and to understand the local point of view. Also
                    interesting facts about coffee, paprika and much more. The view
                    from the Fishermenâ€™s Bastion was fantastic and I enjoyed the
                    cruise on the Danube. I especially loved the Parliament
                    Building.
